This is a reverse-engineered modified version of Indic Keyboard with some bug fixes for Bengali AVRO layout.


• Bugs that are fixed:
1. Hasanta or Virama sign is restored which was missing since v3.4. Just long press on the Bengali period ("।") and the Hasanta sign will get attributed by default.

2. There was a bug where long-pressing on any Bengali number from the number row on AVRO layout was not generating the English numbers from pop-up. I fixed it by disabling the auto AVRO formating of English numbers to Bengali one. You will have to enable the number row from the Preferences section under Settings.
