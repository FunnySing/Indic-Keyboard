# How do I enable it ?
Indic keyboard has a wizard that will walk you through the process of setting it up so that you can use it comfortably.

# When I try to enable the keyboard, I am getting a warning about "collecting data"?
This message is a part of the Android operating system. It will appears whenever you try to enable a third party keyboard. Nothing to worry here.

# What is a keyboard layout ?
Indic keyboard provides multiple "keyboard layouts". This means that you will have different ways to type in your native language.

Transliteration allows you to type out words using English characters, but will automatically transform the words to your native language. For example, if you type "namaste" in English while using Devanagari transliteration keyboard, it will transform it to नमस्ते correctly

Inscript layout is the standardized keyboard that Government of India came up with to cater for the majority of the languages in India. We support the full specification, and if you are already familiar with Inscript on your Desktop, it will work on the phone too.

Phonetic keyboard is similar to Transliteration scheme - you can type what the words sound like using English characters and it will be automatically transformed into your language.

Compact Keyboard allows to type Indian languages without the shift key. You can long press on the letters to get more options.
